Design and develop a static personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, experience, and contact information. The portfolio will serve as my professional online identity, enabling visitors, recruiters, or clients to view my work and learn more about you.
The website should be visually appealing, responsive on all devices, and contain essential sections such as About Me, Projects, Skills, Resume, and Contact. The content should be easy to navigate and demonstrate your personality and professional journey.
